## Done so far
- Read FIFTH_GOAL.md, STATUS.md. Baseline `pnpm test` = 406 pass / 24 files.
- Stage 0 MERGED. Hold-merge fix (failing test first), passive-only offline,
  OFFLINE_FUEL_SHARE=0.5, OFFLINE_HOLD_MULTIPLIER=24, best-water-first when the
  bucket binds, runTrader guarded behind hasAssistant (R63), Assistant now counts
  as transport (canSell). 412 tests green, all four gates. DECISIONS.md updated.
- Stage 1 MERGED: /logbook deleted (1,283 lines).
- Stage 2 MERGED: consignment/Sell button (R65), TOWN_TRIP_SECONDS 40 (R66),
  SAVE_VERSION 5->6 + MIGRATIONS[5] (the pass's ONE bump -- do not bump again).
  430 tests green.
- Ladder seed 7 after Stage 2: first prestige 3h18m09s, crossover 27m02s,
  boat 1h23m11s, Ocean 1h59m27s.
  Prestige chain 3h18m / 20m / 2m48 / 1m35 / 48s / 46s -- the Stage 3 collapse.
- Measure with: LADDER=1 pnpm vitest run src/lib/game/ladder.probe.test.ts --reporter=verbose

## Next steps
1. Stage 3: fix/pearls -- un-square onto sellMultiplier, then fix the collapse
   (spendPearls leaves 99.997% unspent; pearl_headstart maxes at 7 vs 8 sources;
   PEARL_EXPONENT 0.42). New sink: offline hours bought with Pearls.

## Notes / decisions
- SAVE_VERSION currently 5 (config.ts). Bump ONCE to 6 for the whole pass,
  one MIGRATIONS[5]. Decide the bump stage when the first stage needs it.
